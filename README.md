# Mapost v1.0.0

Welcome to **Mapost**, a unique social media application where posts exist in world space, pinned exactly where you want them. Move over traditional feeds—Mapost lets you explore content spatially, making every post an anchor point in the vast digital landscape.

## 🌍 Key Features

1. **Drop a Pin:** Click anywhere on the grid to create a post.
2. **Add Content:** Fill in the title and description—keep it short and impactful!
3. **Navigate Freely:** Scroll, zoom, and pan across the map to discover new posts.
